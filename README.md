# Fragments of code I wrote as a student

As Scott Hanselman put it in [You are not your code](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouAreNotYourCode.aspx):

> Yes, it's a reflection of me, but just as I am not my 8th grade
> English paper or my college entrance scores, I am not the code
> I wrote last year. Feel free to tear it apart.
> I will be better this year.

So I've decided to release some of the code I wrote as a student.
It's not tested, production-ready or anything.

I don't give a damn what you do with it.
